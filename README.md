# Work-Day-Planner
This calendar application uses Luxon dates and time to help users schedule their workday by the hour. 

## What to expect
- User can input their day's 9 to 5 work-schedule and any to-do's in the hourly time-slots
- when the save button is clicked, user's input is stored in their local storage
- when returning to the planner user should find their input remained on the page and in the correct time-slots
- the present/current hour is hight-lighted in red
- hours that have passed have been "grayed-out"
- hours yet to come are high-lighted green

### Luxon API, Javascript/JQuery, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS have been used
